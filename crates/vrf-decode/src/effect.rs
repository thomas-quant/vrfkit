//! Decoder for the shot-effect RepLayoutDynamicArray blobs: the RPC
//! parameters `FloatValues` (`EffectDataFloat`: ammo, projectile count, random
//! seed, tracer option, burst, yaw switch), `ObjectValues` (`EffectDataObject`:
//! firing player state, firing state, equippable) and `VectorValues`
//! (`EffectDataVector`: one attack direction per projectile).
//!
//! # Where this runs
//!
//! vrfkit's `sink/rpc.rs` calls [`decode_effect_blob_json`] for a parameter
//! with one of those names when the overlay produced no value, and puts the
//! JSON into `value_str` **in addition to** `raw_bits`. Like the type overlay
//! it is additive: a failure leaves `value_str` null, keeps the bits and
//! counts. `tools/to_valplay_bundle.py` reads its shot inputs from the raw
//! bits, so the JSON changes nothing it consumes.
//!
//! Where that Python port can return partial elements on malformed input, this
//! decoder rejects the whole array (underfilled member windows, missing or
//! nonzero terminators, residual bits). On real blobs the two agree: 91,827
//! shot arrays from 13.01-13.05 matched in structure, tag and bit pattern.
//!
//! # Wire layout (corpus-validated)
//!
//! ```text
//! [IntPacked: element_count]
//! repeat {
//!     [IntPacked: encoded_index]       // 0 = terminator, else index = encoded - 1
//!     repeat {                         // per element, until handle 0
//!         [IntPacked: encoded_handle]  // 0 = end, else handle = encoded - 1
//!         [IntPacked: payload_bits]
//!         [bits: payload]
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An element is a gameplay-tag index (IntPacked) and a value: an f32, an
//! IntPacked net GUID or three f64s, under a handle pair that depends on the
//! function ([`EffectHandles`](crate::effect::EffectHandles)). An independent
//! parser agrees on `02d4d478`'s 2,647 shots (floats at f32 precision, GUIDs
//! and f64 vectors exactly). Tag indices are replay-specific
//! (`NetworkGameplayTagNodeIndex`); the wiring layer resolves them to names
//! like `FiringState.AmmoRemaining`.
//!
//! Submodules: `framing` (the blob checks and
//! [`scan_element_handles`](crate::effect::scan_element_handles), which derives
//! the handle pair), `elements` (the element type and its decoders) and `json`
//! (the export's rendering).
