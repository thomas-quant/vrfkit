//! Decoders for Valorant struct-array blobs that arrive as opaque raw bits.
//!
//! | Field | Export group | Purpose | Module |
//! |-------|-------------|---------|--------|
//! | `RoundResults` | `BombGameState` | Per-round winning team and outcome | `round_results` |
//! | `TeamEconomy` | `BombGameState` | Team loadout value per round | `team_economy` |
//! | `RoundInfos` | `OwnerExclusivePlayerInfo` | Per-player per-round credit | `round_infos` |
//!
//! All three use the RepLayout dynamic-array framing the effect arrays use
//! (diagrammed in the `effect` module docs); an FName member goes through
//! `FieldType::FName`'s reader with a 1024-byte string cap.
//!
//! # Members are selected by DECLARED NAME, not by handle number
//!
//! Handle numbers are a per-build layout detail: 13.02 moved `RoundResults`'
//! members down by eight, which a handle-keyed decoder reads as nothing. So the
//! decoders take, besides a `reader` over exactly the blob's declared bits,
//! `declared`: the enclosing group's field export names indexed by handle
//! (only the fixed-handle `decode_team_economy` does not). An empty declaration
//! is an error, never a fallback to build-specific numbers.
//!
//! Members and payload types, with each build's handles as a reading aid ONLY:
//!
//! - RoundResults (`BombGameState`; 13.01: 93..=96, 13.02: 81..=84):
//!   `WinningTeam` (FName), `WinningTeamRole` and `RoundResult` (enum bytes of
//!   variable width), `EliminatedTeams` (skipped; declared at TWO consecutive
//!   handles in both builds, one name arm covering both).
//! - RoundInfos (`OwnerExclusivePlayerInfo`; 40..=44 in both builds):
//!   `RoundNumber`, `StartOfRoundMoney`, `StartOfRoundLoadoutValue`,
//!   `EndOfRoundMoney`, `EndOfRoundLoadoutValue` (all Int32).
//! - TeamEconomy (`BombGameState` through 13.01; 53..=55 in the 12.01-12.05
//!   samples, 56..=58 from 12.06): `241`, the ReplicationId declared as a
//!   hardcoded FName index (IntPacked), and `LoadoutValue`,
//!   `AverageLoadoutValue` (Int32). From 13.02 the property lives in
//!   separately replicated BaseTeamState actors. `decode_team_economy` keeps
//!   the fixed 56..=58 layout; `decode_team_economy_declared` follows the
//!   declaration.
