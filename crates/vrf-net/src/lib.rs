//! Unreal Engine replication layer: packets -> bunches -> content blocks -> fields.
//!
//! No field payload is skipped, descriptor or not. Every property and RPC
//! reaches the caller's sink as `(handle, bit_count, raw_bits)`, which works
//! because the field stream is self-describing: each field carries its handle
//! and length.
//!
//! ```text
//! packet  : sentinel-trimmed byte slice -> bit stream
//! bunch   : header + partial reassembly state machine
//! content : framing loop; header + payload per block
//! field   : self-describing handle/size stream
//! ```
//!
//! The caller injects export-group resolution (which names map to which
//! handles), typed field decoding, and NetGuidCache storage (through
//! [`net_guid::GuidPathSink`]).
//!
//! A malformed bunch is discarded and counted; it does not abort the replay,
//! and no discard goes uncounted.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! `diagnostics` (default) adds only the per-failure event log in [`stats`]:
//! `DiagnosticEvent`, `SkipReason`, the two snapshot types and the two
//! `NetStats` fields that hold them. The counters are in every build -- a
//! build without them would lose data silently -- and nothing else is
//! optional: packets, bunches, content blocks and fields are one state machine.
