//! Top-level replication reader that drives the full pipeline.
//!
//! One pass connects packets -> bunches -> content blocks -> fields. The
//! caller provides a [`ReplicationSink`] for the decoded events (fields, RPCs,
//! actor lifecycle) and the replay branch that selects the payload transform.
//!
//! Stages: channel (open/close, GUID preambles), spawn (dynamic-actor spawn
//! block), framing (content blocks, fields, RPCs); this file holds the sink
//! trait, partial routing and the header stages. Measured rates:
//! docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md#measured-rates-reference-replay-02d4d478.
//!
//! The steady state allocates nothing per packet, bunch or content block
//! (docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md#allocation-strategy): `scratch`,
//! `fragment_stage` and the channel table (a row per channel index, never per
//! bunch) are reused, and bunch payloads are sub-readers of the caller's
//! packet bytes.
