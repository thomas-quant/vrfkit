//! The input structs the writers consume. They carry no Arrow or Parquet
//! types, so they compile with `parquet` off and a consumer such as `vrfkit
//! validate` gets records without arrow, parquet or zstd in its build.
//!
//! The two name columns are `Arc<str>`, interned once by the producer and
//! cloned per row: 475 distinct `group_path` values and a few thousand field
//! names cover a whole replay, so a row costs a refcount, not an allocation.
//! The dictionary builders are fed `&str` either way, so the bytes on disk are
//! unchanged. Counts: docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md#name-interning.
