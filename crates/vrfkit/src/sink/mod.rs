//! Sink implementation connecting `vrf-net` events to `vrf-export` records.
//!
//! # Design: no skipping
//!
//! Every field and RPC is emitted, even when its group path or field name does
//! not resolve: then `group_path = "<unknown:{guid}>"` and `field_name = None`.
//! A block an unresolved ClassNetCache function table leaves unsplittable is
//! emitted whole as one marked preservation row, never as fabricated fields, so
//! the Parquet output stays a **lossless** representation of the stream.
//!
//! `vrfkit validate` runs this whole path and writes no file, so it times the
//! sink alone: docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md#what-the-whole-sink-costs.
