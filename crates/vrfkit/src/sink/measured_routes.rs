//! Which checksum-gated structured-array routes a replay branch admits.
//!
//! A [`MeasuredArrayRoute`] expands one exact (group, parent, checksum) identity
//! into additive child rows and types children through handle-keyed member
//! tables, so where a build moved a member the route refuses (counted) or
//! leaves children untyped: the gate is per build AND per route. A route is
//! admitted only where it was observed on that build's replays with every array
//! counter at zero and an independent decoder matched every child; unobserved
//! is not verified and stays off. Measurements: docs/LEGACY_BUILD_SUPPORT.md.
