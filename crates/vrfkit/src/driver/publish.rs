//! Same-volume staging and publication of one complete export directory.
//!
//! A run writes into `.{out}.vrfkit-staging-{pid}-{nonce}` beside the
//! destination and publishes by renaming it over `--out`, moving any prior
//! output aside to `.{out}.vrfkit-previous-{pid}-{nonce}` in between. `Drop`
//! removes the staging directory of a run that fails in-process. A killed
//! process (`Stop-Process -Force`, power loss, a console Ctrl+C: no handler is
//! installed) runs no destructor and leaves staging behind with footerless
//! tables; a kill between `publish`'s two renames strands the prior output, a
//! complete export, in its `previous` sibling.
//!
//! The next export to the same destination names each such sibling and
//! deletes nothing ([`report_leftovers`]). `tools/export_scan.py` recognises
//! the same names, and `tools/tests/test_export_scan.py` reads
//! [`GENERATED_INFIX`], [`STAGING`], [`PREVIOUS`] and `generated_name`'s
//! format string out of this file: keep them verbatim.
