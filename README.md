# vrfkit

A Rust toolkit that parses VALORANT replay files (`.vrf`, Unreal Engine network
replay format) and exports them to Parquet. A workspace of 10 crates (plus a
test-only `dev/vrf-testkit` and the `extract-component-classes` tool) and a
Python `tools/` validation suite. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is in every crate;
there is no `unsafe` block anywhere in the workspace. The only native FFI the
parser depends on is Oodle decompression, and that lives entirely in the
external `oozextract` crate. Edition 2024, MSRV 1.86, Apache-2.0.

## Why this exists

Most replay parsers export only the fields whose type they know. vrfkit's
design premise is the opposite: **export every value the replay carries.** This
is possible because Unreal's property stream is self-describing -- each field
carries a handle and a bit-length *before* its value, so field boundaries are
walkable without knowing the type, and the handle-to-name map ships inside the
replay itself (`NetFieldExportGroup`). Where that map is available, names can
be resolved independently of types. Unknown properties retain raw payloads;
typed values are an additive overlay. This is a preservation strategy, not a
claim that every stream is currently understood: framing failures and missing
schema attribution are measured separately, and successful movement decodes
can be represented by their rows instead of a duplicate raw RPC.

Measured 2026-09-28 on all **1,018 unique available replays** across the 24
supported branches, every row by the [same acceptance rule](docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md):
ReplayData validation, checkpoint-enabled export, the independent comparisons on
observed evidence fields, and the strict array and array-leaf error counters.
✅ **1,018/1,018** are clean -- not a claim that every field is understood.
Structured-array child rows are admitted per build and per route: all
measured routes on 13.01--13.06, a measured subset on 11.06--13.00
([legacy route table](docs/LEGACY_BUILD_SUPPORT.md#measured-array-routes)).

All branches are `++Ares-Core+release-<build>`. Adding a build is one
`transforms!` line; see [Adding a new build](#supported-builds-and-the-cost-of-a-new-build).

## Highlights

- **Preservation with explicit accounting** — unknown property payloads and
  unresolved whole RPCs remain raw; stream failures remain visible. Typed
  values are an *additive* overlay, and the nullable `compatible_checksum`
  column helps distinguish untyped fields from fields lacking a descriptor.
- **Self-describing stream** — field names come from the replay itself
  (`NetFieldExportGroup`); no hardcoded agent or map names in the parser.
- **Main and checkpoint Parquet output** — six main tables are always written;
  `--checkpoints` adds seven checkpoint tables. All are ready for polars,
  pandas, or DuckDB.
- **Spike state** — plant site A/B (`PlantedAtSite` + position), defuser
  (`CurrentDefuser`), timer, and the canonical detonation signal.
- **Combat & abilities** — per-player economy, magazine and reserve ammo,
  equipped weapon over time, cooldowns, and absolute health, armour and overheal
  from the damage log — the value after each change, not a running subtraction.
- **Ability observations** — cast time/location and replicated ability
  statistics can be joined to actors and rounds. Repeated snapshots require
  deduplication; unresolved ownership and incomplete effect pairs remain gaps.
- **Numeric FastArray observations** — the standalone GAS extractor retains
  replication keys, deleted/changed item IDs and raw property boundaries; every
  window it reads in the 1,018-export audit closed exactly
  ([investigation](docs/GAS_AND_PATCHVOLUME_INVESTIGATION.md)). Property names
  and gameplay meanings remain unverified, and this output is separate from
  Parquet typed-value coverage.
- **Status-effect observations** — nearsight, slow, detain and suppress can
  arrive on affected actors. Matched start/stop records support intervals;
  unmatched records must not be assigned an invented duration.
- **Persistent effects** — smoke / wall / molly / slow / trap position and
  lifetime from actor lifecycles; one command via
  `tools/extract_active_effects.py`.
- **Spike custody** — who carried the spike and when, resolved to the account
  UUID, including Gekko's Wingman as a proxy carrier and the planter at each
  `spikePlanted`; one command via `tools/extract_spike_carrier.py`.
- **Account identity & typed events** — `manifest.players` (account UUID →
  actor → character), event `word0`/`word1` (killer/killed NetGUID, round
  index), ping/latency.
- **Cross-validated** -- the server-written Event chunk independently confirms
  the kill log: 132/132 in order on one 13.01 replay, 9,677/9,677 over 71
  replays on 13.02.
- **Reproducible** — Parquet output is byte-for-byte identical run to run.
- **No `unsafe`** — `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in every crate; the only FFI is
  Oodle, isolated in an external crate.
- **807 Rust tests** plus a layered validation suite (framing / bytes / decode
  errors / semantics).

## Quick start

```bash
cargo +1.86.0 build --release -p vrfkit --features export --locked

vrfkit inspect  <file.vrf>                          # header / branch / chunk summary
vrfkit validate <file.vrf> [--diagnostics]          # grammar oracle, writes nothing
vrfkit export   <file.vrf> --out <dir> [--checkpoints]
```

`inspect` prints replay info, header, branch, and a chunk summary; it does no
parsing and returns immediately. `validate` walks every content block through
the RepLayout grammar and reports a pass rate; it writes no files. `export`
writes the Parquet tables and manifest described under [Output](#output) into
`--out`, which must be new, empty or a previous export: anything else in it
is refused, never deleted.

On `02d4d478` (48,215,213 bytes, build 13.01), `export` produces thirteen
Parquet files plus a manifest when checkpoints are included:

| File | Rows | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `fields.parquet` | 1,296,660 | 12,691,843 |
| `movement.parquet` | 1,844,147 | 19,984,802 |
| `actors.parquet` | 3,827 | 76,830 |
| `net_guids.parquet` | 16,167 | 114,423 |
| `events.parquet` | 195 | 12,455 |
| `partials.parquet` | 0 | 2,505 |
| `checkpoint_fields.parquet` | 352,089 | 1,193,006 |
| `checkpoint_actors.parquet` | 3,014 | 25,848 |
| `checkpoint_net_guids.parquet` | 74,270 | 175,916 |
| `checkpoint_blocks.parquet` | 22,247 | 112,649 |
| `checkpoint_guid_entries.parquet` | 74,270 | 219,662 |
| `checkpoint_export_groups.parquet` | 8,307 | 16,481 |
| `checkpoint_export_fields.parquet` | 49,314 | 106,370 |
| `manifest.json` |  | ~660,030 |

`checkpoint_fields.parquet` requires `--checkpoints`. The partials row above
shows the default main-only export; both modes currently contain zero
rejected partial rows and occupy 2,505 bytes. The five original main tables remain
byte-for-byte identical across the checkpoint flag.

## Output

The main export writes six Parquet tables plus `manifest.json`; `--checkpoints`
adds seven checkpoint tables. The tables, their columns, the join rules and
the traps (a per-round tick, `open` / `close` / `dormant`, an `FDateTime`
timestamp) are in [`docs/USAGE.md` section 3](docs/USAGE.md#3-output).

## Status

Work in progress. Currently verified: `cargo +1.86.0 test --workspace --locked`
**807 passing**; the full Python suite also has **1233 passing** tests. The
full documentation check passes. The latest [common build audit](docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md)
records replay validation, checkpoint export and independent value checks for
each supported build.

Tagged Windows releases provide a ZIP and SHA-256 checksum. The release
workflow runs the complete CI on the tagged commit, checks the packaged binary
against a public replay, and publishes the verified ZIP without rebuilding it.
The same packaging checks run on PRs. See [release maintenance](CONTRIBUTING.md#tagged-windows-releases)
for tag naming and validation before publishing.

What CI runs, three pinned public replays included, is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#what-ci-runs); the private-corpus checks stay
local.

The crates, their layers and feature flags are in
[`docs/USAGE.md` section 4](docs/USAGE.md#4-using-it-as-a-library), and the
layered validation suite and what each layer misses in
[section 6](docs/USAGE.md#6-validation-suite). Timing
is `tools/bench_export.py`; the optimizations kept and rejected, with their
measurements, are in [`docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md).

## The Event chunk -- the server's own timeline

The `.vrf` Event chunk is the event list the server labeled and wrote itself,
stored elsewhere in the file under a different encoding. vrfkit reads it.

```
characterDeath 132 | characterUltimateUsed 34 | roundStarted 18
spikePlanted 9 | spikeDefused 1 | switchTeams 1          (02d4d478, 195 events)
```

The 132 `characterDeath` events exactly match the 132 `MulticastNotifyKilledEnemy`
events we extracted from RPCs. The two payload words are the killer/killed
NetGUIDs, and **132/132 match in order** (0/132 matched reversed).

Scope, to be precise: the killer/killed pair diff is for **one replay**. A
separate Event-only sweep covered **527 files and 109,126 chunks** across
releases 13.01, 13.02 and 13.04. Every outer chunk and known inner payload was
consumed exactly, with zero unknown groups and zero residual bytes.

The payload layout is `[u32 group tag][N x u32 words][FString
"EReplayEventGroup::<Name>"][f32 seconds]`, and `N` differs per group. The `N`
for all seven groups is derived from the corpus as the residual-zero count
(CharacterDeath = 2, CharacterUltimateUsed / RoundStart / SwitchTeams = 1,
SpikePlanted / Defused / Exploded = 0). The same sweep established one stable
tag per group (respectively 8, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6), public enum-name strings
of at most 40 bytes, and a maximum `payload_seconds * 1000 - time1` absolute
difference of 0.999878 ms. vrfkit requires all four checks within a 1.001 ms
time tolerance before exporting `word0`/`word1`, `payload_tag`, `payload_name`
and `payload_seconds`; on any mismatch those nullable columns stay empty. The
original is always left intact in `raw_payload`.

## Whole-corpus robustness

The [common audit](docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md) checks 1,018 unique replays
across 24 builds: every ReplayData validation and checkpoint export succeeds,
independent typed/raw comparisons match 13,387,751 observed values, and all
1,018 pass the strict quality gate.

A 100% block pass rate means every measured block reached an ordinary
field/RPC row or an explicit preservation row; partial reassembly rejections
are outside that score, and `malformed framing 0` does not prove that earlier
transport stages kept every payload. It is **not** a typing claim either: a
block that cannot be assigned a `_ClassNetCache` group has inner handles
nothing can name, so it becomes one reserved row (`handle = u32::MAX`, the
complete decoded payload in `raw_bits`) counted under `RPC unresolved/raw` --
uninterpreted, not lost.

## Type overlay

For any field whose inner stream can be walked, the raw bits are always
exported; when the type is known, the `value_*` columns are filled **as an
overlay.** If the type is unknown, or decoding fails, the row's `raw_bits`
remains. The only exception is a ClassNetCache block whose group cannot be
identified: it cannot be expanded into fields, so it emits one preservation
row (`handle` = `u32::MAX`, full payload in `raw_bits`) and an explicit
unresolved/raw diagnostic rather than pretending the properties were decoded.

The overlay table (`crates/vrf-decode/src/table.rs`) -- 222 groups, 1,118
entries, 96 handles -- is maintained in the repository, and
`tools/apply_type_corrections.py --check` keeps every measured type in it.
Four names resolve without a table entry: `Owner`, `Instigator`,
`AttachParent` and `Controller` are object references the engine replicates
on every actor, always as a NetGUID, so they resolve by name after the table
and the scoped types miss -- a claim about Unreal, not about one Blueprint.

`02d4d478` (`02d4d478-1dfb-4412-9a77-29ca29105a9d.vrf`), as recorded by the
committed export baseline `tools/baselines/export_02d4d478.json`:

```
Decoded OK:   822,185      Decode errors:      0
Raw/Skip:      24,747      Not in table: 140,814
No field name:  1,249      Typed:          83.1%
Effect blobs:  61,617
```

The four buckets partition `Rows offered` exactly (822,185 + 24,747 + 140,814 +
1,249 = 988,995), and `Typed` is `Decoded OK / Rows offered`. `check_docs.py`
compares these counters and the Parquet row/byte table with that baseline.

**Effect decoding is additive and does not move these buckets.** The overlay
buckets are settled before the effect pass, so rows that gained a value from an
effect are still counted under `Not in table`; merging them into `Decoded OK`
would double-count and move the baseline for unrelated reasons. `Effect blobs`
is reported separately -- without it, 61,617 rows gain a value yet the summary
prints identically.

Physical value coverage -- `fields.parquet` rows with a non-null `value_*` --
is a different population from the overlay's input rows: the reference
baseline has 939,382 typed rows out of 1,296,660 (72.45%), measured from its
columns, and it is not a fraction of all game information understood.
`Typed`, the overlay counter, the `compatible_checksum` buckets that separate
"nobody described this" from "we missed this", and
`tools/summarize_value_coverage.py` for your own exports are in
[`docs/USAGE.md`](docs/USAGE.md#fieldsparquet). Decode errors are checked
separately by `tools/check_decode_errors_corpus.py`, because `vrfkit validate`
prints no overlay counters.

## Supported builds and the cost of a new build

The payload transform changes per game build, but far more is **constant**
across supported releases 11.06 through 13.06: the PRNG and its multipliers, the seed-mix
skeleton, the 64 -> 32 -> 8 -> tail staging, the tail-XOR handling, and even
the S-box table itself. Each build supplies its own `word64` / `word32` /
`byte` operation sequence (order, rotations, complements, and whether the
S-box stage is used) plus these constants:

| | seed addend | offset | sign | S-box |

| release-13.06 | `0xe974593c` | `0x3c` | **+** | used |

In all twenty-four supported builds the **tail-XOR byte equals the low byte of the seed
addend.** It is a derived value, not an independent constant: `SeededTransform`
in `crates/vrf-transform/src/lib.rs` defaults `TAIL_XOR` to `SEED_ADDEND as
u8`, and a build that broke the pattern would fail its 1- and 7-bit vectors,
which `vectors_cover_the_staging_boundaries` in
`crates/vrf-transform/tests/golden.rs` requires for every registered build.

So adding a build is one `transforms!` line in `crates/vrf-transform/src/lib.rs`:
its branch, `SEED_ADDEND`, signed `INIT_A_OFFSET` and the step list of its
word64 / word32 / byte stages; everything else is shared.

Every build in the table above is confirmed on live replays, not only by
transform vectors. A machine-local corpus can rotate; the reproducible oracle is
88 mechanically extracted golden vectors (11 staging boundaries per
build, eight builds) plus 1,264 native-machine-code vectors for the sixteen
recovered 11.06--12.09 builds, with a full 48-sample main/checkpoint validation
([build support validation report](docs/LEGACY_BUILD_SUPPORT.md)). The
[common audit](docs/BUILD_VERIFICATION.md) checks 38 13.06 replays.

The 768-byte S-box is shared across builds, which makes it usable as a
**signature for locating the transform function in a binary.**

## Design

### 1. Parallel across replays, sequential within one

The content-block header and declared bit-length are plaintext, and only the
payload transform is a pure function of `(bits, seed)`. Decode is not: it reads
the GUID cache and channel state earlier blocks mutate, and a stale group sets
the wrong handle width, so a replay decodes in order and parallelism is per
replay ([why](docs/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md#decode-stays-sequential-within-a-replay)).

### 2. Output is Parquet

Columnar storage collapses the repeated path and name strings via dictionary
encoding, zstd compresses it well, and it reads directly in `pyarrow` /
`polars` / `pandas` / `duckdb`. NDJSON is reader-bound: on a 1.8-million-row
movement stream, JSON parsing was measured at 84% of processing time.

## Generated files

The following files are generated and must never be edited by hand:
