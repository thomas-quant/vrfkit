"""Every crate carries the workspace's license text and the earlier MIT notice.

`cargo package` builds a crate's archive from the crate directory, so the root
LICENSE and NOTICE.md never reach it; each crate's own files ship beside the
`license` field it inherits. `cargo metadata` reads only that field, so it
passes a crate LICENSE that holds another license's text.

Code contributed before the change to Apache-2.0 was contributed under MIT,
which allows other terms only while its notice stays with the code. The root
NOTICE.md keeps that notice in its first section, before the third-party
notices, and every crate's NOTICE.md opens with the same section.
