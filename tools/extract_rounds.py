"""Derive rounds.parquet from an export: one row per played round.

Rows come from the game state's `MulticastSetPhase.NewPhase` RPC: 2 reset,
3 round start, 4 buy phase end, 5 an unnamed post-round phase (no RPC names
it), 6 side switch (on the round before the switch). Each phase but 5 is
checked against the named RPC sent in the same frame; any difference fails
the run. `buy_end_ms` is the epoch of `AbilityCastsThisRound[].CastTime`. A
phase the replay lacks stays null.

`RoundResults` is joined by `RoundNumber` but never makes a row: a surrender
pads it with awarded rounds nobody played (12 on each public fixture).
