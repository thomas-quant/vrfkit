"""Assert that the prose docs still describe THIS repo.

A number measured once gets quoted forever, and a stale sentence compiles and
passes every test. So this reads the repo and the docs and compares:

  1. every tools/*.py script is mentioned in USAGE, and every one it names exists
  2. every crate has a row in USAGE's layer table
  3. README and USAGE quote the live overlay table sizes, and no quoted size
     in `ALL_DOCS`, Rust doc comments or Cargo.toml is stale
  4. README and USAGE quote the live test counts, and no stale count sits
     beside a live one; `--fast` keeps only `contradicting_test_counts`
  5. no `MEASURED_RE` count in `ALL_DOCS` is stale, and a count that could not
     be measured is reported rather than skipped
  6. every relative link in `ALL_DOCS` and docs/*.md resolves
  7. CONTRIBUTING and the PR template name every generated target
  8. USAGE's export rows/bytes match the committed baseline JSON, whose five
     overlay buckets still partition `overlay_rows_offered`; no quoted overlay
     counter or `Typed` ratio is stale, and README still carries the block
  9. README's build table covers exactly the registered payload transforms,
     with the audit's clean/checked counts and one verification method
 10. every `#anchor` a doc links, and every `docs/<name>.md[#<anchor>]` a
     tracked .rs, .py or .json file names, exists by GitHub's slug rules;
     Setext headings are not read, so a link to one is reported

A number is guarded when something in the repo can be *run* to produce it;
DATA.md's measurements come from analysis runs, so they are not. (8) reads
committed JSON, so no `.vrf` is needed. (4) runs `cargo test` and the tools
suite; CI runs the full guard in the Windows MSRV job and `--fast` on the
Python matrix.

Usage:
    python tools/check_docs.py
    python tools/check_docs.py --fast     # skip (4)'s suite runs
