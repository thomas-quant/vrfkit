"""Convert a vrfkit Parquet export into a valplay-compatible NDJSON bundle.

Writes the events.ndjson, movement.ndjson and manifest.json that valplay's
compute_metrics.py consumes; only the serialization is bridged, no metric is
reimplemented. Replicated properties group by (packet_id, actor, object,
group_path) into export_group_received events; RPCs (group_path contains
'_ClassNetCache') by (packet_id, actor, group_path, handle) into rpc_received.
A shot RPC also becomes a valorant_shot_received event: its effect blobs are
decoded with the manifest's gameplay-tag table, and the gun is the
FiringState subobject's outer (net_guids.parquet) named from its class path
(actors.parquet, equippable_table.py).

Usage:
    python tools/to_valplay_bundle.py <vrfkit_export_dir> [-o <output_dir>]
