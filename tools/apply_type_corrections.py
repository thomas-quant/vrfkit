"""Pin measured field types in crates/vrf-decode/src/table.rs.

A pin is `(group, field, FieldType)` with its evidence beside it. A CORRECTION
types an entry the wire contradicted; an ADDITION types a field no declaration
covered, under the bar written above `ADDITIONS`. An exact pin is set, and
inserted when absent; a glob pin (`*`) sets every entry it matches and must
match at least one. Applying also sorts the table and resyncs its length.

Usage:
    python tools/apply_type_corrections.py            # apply every pin
    python tools/apply_type_corrections.py --check    # fail unless applying changes nothing
