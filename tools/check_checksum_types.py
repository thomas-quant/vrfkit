"""Check vrfkit's overlay types against the replay's own `compatible_checksum`.

Every `NetFieldExport` a replay declares carries a `compatible_checksum`, and
Unreal computes it from the property's NAME and its C++ TYPE
(`GetRepLayoutCmdCompatibleChecksum` in UE 5.3 `RepLayout.cpp`):

    crc = StrCrc32(lower(name), parent)       # every TCHAR fed as 4 bytes, LE
    crc = StrCrc32(lower(cpp_type), crc)      # e.g. "int32", "fvector", "aactor*"
    crc = MemCrc32(<u32 LE static index>, crc)

`StrCrc32` and `MemCrc32` are the standard reflected CRC-32 (zlib's), so this
is `zlib.crc32` over the UTF-32LE bytes of the lower-cased strings, then the
little-endian static-array index. `parent` is 0 for a class property or an
RPC parameter; a member of a flattened (non-NetSerialize) struct continues
from its struct property's checksum, and a `TArray`'s inner element from the
array's. The formula was measured against 13.06 replays by the game-file
analysis of 2026-09-28 (194 Blueprint fields and several native identities
reproduce); the per-build count of reproduced identities this tool prints is
what carries it to other builds.

So a checksum is evidence about a TYPE that no descriptor, table or decoder
in this repo contributed. This tool turns it into a check of the overlay:

 1. Collect every declared identity -- `(group, field name, handle,
    checksum)` from `manifest.json`'s `net_field_export_groups` and, when
    present, `checkpoint_export_groups/fields.parquet` -- of one or more
    exports.
 2. Resolve the `FieldType` vrfkit gives it through overlay_mirror, which
    follows `overlay::resolve_entry` over the overlay tables. Validated
    2026-09-28: 12,937 of 12,937 distinct corpus identities resolve to the
    same `FieldType` as the Rust `resolve_field_type_with_checksum`, and on 7
    exports (11.06-13.06, main and checkpoint) the identities this calls typed
    are exactly the ones whose rows carry a `value_*` (see
    docs/CHECKSUM_TYPES.md).
 3. Tier 1: map the `FieldType` to the C++ spellings it can stand for
    (`CPP_TYPES`) and recompute the checksum under every KNOWN parent seed:
    0, and the struct chains in `PARENT_CHAINS`, each with its provenance.
 4. Tier 2: recover more parent seeds from the replay itself -- members of one
    struct typed right imply the same parent (`SiblingSeeds`) -- and re-test
    under them what tier 1 left untestable in that group. Tier 2 never sees
    `PARENT_CHAINS`, so it re-derives their seeds independently, and a chain
    seed it contradicts fails the run.

Each typed identity lands in exactly one of three buckets:

    match       vrfkit's type reproduces the declared checksum
    mismatch    vrfkit's type does not, but another C++ spelling in
                `ALTERNATIVE_TYPES` (or an object pointer) does, under the
                same seeds -- the checksum names a different type
    untestable  nothing reproduces it, so the checksum says nothing here

`untestable` is never a match. The reasons are counted separately:

  * enum-capable types (`Byte`, `EnumByte`, `EnumRemainingBits`, a
    `SerializedInt` whose bound is not a whole unsigned width). A C++ enum
    spelling (`TEnumAsByte<E>`, `E`, `E::Type`) has never been seen to
    reproduce, so an enum property is untestable; a plain `uint8` still
    counts, and an alternative that reproduces is still a mismatch.
  * object references whose class is not among the candidates: the classes
    the input itself declares groups for plus `ENGINE_CLASSES`, so a
    reference to an undeclared class (a data asset, say) cannot be spelled.
  * members of a flattened struct or array whose parent chain is not in
    `PARENT_CHAINS` and whose siblings do not give it back (fewer than two
    testable members, or only an ambiguous agreement). An object reference
    offers only `UClass*` towards a parent: its thousands of `A<Class>*` /
    `U<Class>*` candidates would make the agreement a lottery, so they are
    tested at the parents others establish and never set one.
  * a bare FName index (`"108"`) not in `HARDCODED_FNAMES`, a non-ASCII name,
    or a declared checksum of 0.

What it cannot tell apart, by construction:

  * `Bool` reproduced as `uint8` is a bitfield bool (`uint8 bFoo:1`) or a
    byte; the checksum names the storage type, and only the wire width
    separates the two. Counted on its own line.
  * A match says the name and C++ type are what the declaration hashed, not
    the wire FORMAT a NetSerialize type uses, a quantization scale the C++
    type does not name, or the meaning of a value -- `decode errors: 0` and
    the value checks remain the evidence for those.
  * Groups it never saw. Coverage is the input's; run it on the corpus.

Every `checksum_table.rs` entry is checked the same way, under every name that
declares its checksum in the input; entries no declaration carries are
counted, not failed.

Every counter prints with its zeros, and so does the price of every
recomputation: each is a 1-in-2^32 chance of an accidental reproduction, and
each comparison of two implied parents a 1-in-2^32 chance of an accidental
agreement, so the expected number of each is printed beside the verdicts.

A mismatch vrfkit keeps on purpose is listed, with its reason and evidence,
in `tools/fixtures/checksum_types_expected.json`. An item names one mismatch
shape exactly and covers every identity and `checksum_table.rs` carrier of
that shape. It applies wherever the input declares its checksum outside the
ClassNetCache groups, so an item whose mismatch is gone is STALE; an item
whose checksum the input does not declare is not applicable, so a single
export can still be checked. A mismatch a sibling seed decided cannot be
listed (its label embeds the establishing pair, no stable key), so its chain
must be named in `PARENT_CHAINS` first.

Exit status: 0 when every mismatch is one an item names exactly and no item
is STALE; 1 when a mismatch is not listed, when an item is STALE, when
nothing was checked, or when a parent chain and the sibling tier disagree; 2
when an input, an overlay table or the expected list cannot be read
completely (an entry that does not parse, a `FieldType` variant `CPP_TYPES`
does not classify, or a malformed item).

    right -- except for the systematic false agreement this class refuses.

    A wrong hypothesis of the truth's length shifts the implied parent by an
    amount fixed by WHERE in the hashed string it is wrong and HOW
    (`deviation`), so two members wrong the same way still agree, at a wrong
    parent. That happens when:

      A. both names have the same length and both get the same wrong
         spelling of the same wrong truth. The corpus has it: the four 1-char
         GUID words `A`/`B`/`C`/`D` of `BombPlayerState` imply one parent
         under `int32`, `uint8`, `float` and `FName` alike, or

         the spellings (`uint32` read as `uint64` beside `int32` read as
         `int64`, names one character apart).

    So a pair establishes a parent only if it is neither A (checked
    directly, whatever the truth) nor B for any two spellings in the tool's
    universe, every alternative and object pointer it knows (`deviation` keys
    must not intersect). An alternative of a different length cannot agree
    systematically: its shift depends on the name's own CRC. What remains is
    chance, each comparison of implied parents a 1-in-2^32 ticket counted in
    `comparisons`, and one blind spot: two truths OUTSIDE the universe that
    deviate identically from their hypotheses, at offsets B aligns, would be
    taken for right.
